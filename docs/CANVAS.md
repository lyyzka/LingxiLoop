# Shared Canvas architecture

LingxiLoop Canvas follows one invariant: **shared state, isolated execution**.

Each ordinary chat conversation gets one durable Canvas automatically when its
Canvas workspace is first opened. Users cannot create additional canvases for a
conversation; the conversation identity is the idempotent ownership key.

The shared boundary contains only conversation-scoped Canvas records:

- `canvases` identifies a durable learning-task workspace and its source conversation, trigger, goal, initiator, and lifecycle. A tenant may retain many historical workspaces.
- `canvas_frames` stores typed frame geometry, content and revision metadata.
- `canvas_agent_assignments` and `canvas_assignment_dependencies` store the Agent roster, stable colors, work zones, cursor/focus, results, and dependency DAG.
- `canvas_presence` stores short-lived human/Agent working status and cursors.
- `canvas_comments` and `canvas_activity` provide discussion and audit history.

Human frame mutations use authenticated `/api/canvas` routes. The learning Agent
still decides when a workspace helps and allocates the initial capable peers.
Inside an active workspace, humans can right-click the blank stage to @ an Agent
with additional work, create a typed frame, or click a frame to send focused
feedback. Those actions steer the same durable Agent work items instead of
creating a separate collaboration surface.
Agent mutations use the
LingxiOS native tools (`canvas.available_agents`, `canvas.start_workspace`,
`canvas.add_agents`, `canvas.get`, `canvas.create_frame`,
`canvas.update_frame`, `canvas.append_content`, `canvas.delete_frame`, and
`canvas.set_status`). Each tool retains product tenant authorization, LingxiOS work
leases and the durable action receipt.

`start_workspace` returns an internal runtime directive. It tells the initiating
runtime to persist its session and defer safely after the live Canvas card
exists. Dependency-free assignments enter the durable queue immediately.
Workers write final text to their assignment instead of the conversation,
unlock downstream work, and eventually enqueue one `canvas_summary` work item
for the initiating Agent. Stopping the whole workspace suppresses that summary.

Postgres is authoritative. Each committed mutation publishes a small
tenant-tagged event on the existing Redis bus, which the existing `/ws` server
fans out to connected workspace members. Reconnects reconcile with a fresh
Canvas snapshot. Deltas carry timestamps and content revisions; clients ignore
older revisions. Content replacement uses `baseRevision` optimistic concurrency,
while append remains an atomic database operation.

Frame types are deliberately open beyond HTML: `html`, `markdown`, `document`,
`image`, and `artifact` are first-class values. HTML renders in an isolated
sandboxed iframe; it never executes in the LingxiLoop application origin.

Canvas introduces no collaboration container, MCP service, Docker runtime,
Screen/X11 session, browser profile, or shared filesystem. LingxiOS kernels and
their Agent Homes remain isolated exactly as before.

The server implementation is one vertical slice under `server/src/modules/canvas`:
`contracts.ts` owns Zod and event/DTO contracts, `router.ts` maps authenticated
HTTP requests, `application.ts` owns validation, transactions and publication,
and `repository.ts` owns every parameterized query and lock primitive. LingxiOS
and integration callers import only the public `index.ts`; the former
`server/src/canvas/service.ts` path does not exist.

The browser implementation is co-located under `src/features/canvas`: API,
contracts, Zustand state, Canvas-only reducers and business components share
one feature boundary. HTTP still uses the shared transport and realtime still
uses the single shared WebSocket client.

The interaction and data model were independently designed after studying
Doop's public architecture: stable identity colors, presence, task timelines,
ghost work frames, editor highlights, and a unified realtime event layer. No
Doop source code or service is included, keeping LingxiLoop's MIT license
boundary intact.
