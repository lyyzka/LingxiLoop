# assistant-ui Streaming

Inspect the installed package and the relevant `references/` protocol file before editing.

- Reuse the existing stream format and transport. Use AI SDK UI streams when the app already uses AI SDK; use `assistant-stream` only for a custom backend.
- Preserve event order, cancellation, errors, completion, and tool-call identifiers.
- Validate the actual response content type and a focused streamed text/tool-call path.
